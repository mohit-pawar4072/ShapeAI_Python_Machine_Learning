# Artificial Intelligence in financial risk management
	

Final project for the Building AI course
	
	

## Summary
	
This project's goal is to provide a tool, that would allow for easier and better assessment of the financial risk. AI-based tool to help people that are investing on a stock markets assess the risk is the main target of this project.

	

## Background
	
When it comes to risk management, people (or in this case investors, to be more precise) often tend to (for example) overestimate possible events with very big impact on the price of asset, yet with very low probability of happening. At the same time they often underestimate possible events with small impact on the price of asset, yet with very high probability of happening and/or possible multiple occurance, effectively affecting an asset the same amout as the low probability event. That problem could be solved by an AI 'advisor' able to analyse the data and calculate the real risk and eventually advise whether or not sell/buy an asset. Also, with the AI solution we could resign from traditional methods of risk valuation and try to develop a new one, based on a real data (with possibility to use past data to train the model - we can take the data from past to train the model, where our expected result would be let's say today's price of an asset).
	


## How is it used?
	
Solution would be available for everyone, yet everyone would be using it on their own responsibility (predictions are still only predictions, investors are the ones deciding whether or not they will do what AI advises as it can not always be good advise! The use itself would be very simple - just give the program an index of a listed company, give it time to process the data and check out the results.

	

## Data sources and AI methods
	
As we are talking about investing on a stock market and managing/valuating risk, the access to data is very simple - everyday prices of shares of listed companies (or any other financial instruments) are commonly available in multiple sources. In case of this project, the most desirable data source would be the one providing an API, so the program could gather necessary data by itself, without a need of a person uploading any data sets manually.
	


## Challenges
	
The main challange when it comes to stock markets is behavior of other investors (that sometimes might be illogical) and random events (such as virus outbreak in China) that can cause very strong impact on a market and are nearly impossible to predict/have extremaly low probability of happening. 
	
	

## What next?	

Data gathering, building a simple model for first tests and looking where it goes!
